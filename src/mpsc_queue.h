/**
 * A concurrent multi-producer, single-consumer, lock-free, FIFO queue.
 *
 * This is an extension of Dmitry Vyukov's MPSC non-intrusive queue
 * (bit.ly/vyukov-mpsc). The extension trades the cost of producer/consumer
 * containtion at the tail for added functionality of consumers being able to
 * infer that the consumer *may* have observed an empty queue. This enables a
 * use model where fewer "work available" notifications are sent to a
 * non-busy-waiting consumer when there are concurrent producers. TODO: profiling
 * this trade-off under representative loads would be welcome.
 *
 * The element type `T` must be default-constructible.
